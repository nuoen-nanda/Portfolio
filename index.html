        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>My Background & Motivation</h2>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering.</p>
        <p>BUT. In university, I absolutely hated programming when I first learnt it.
          I had to take a pre-requisite module on C, and I found it extremely confusing and complicated, and I totally couldn't see where I was going with it.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="turning-point"><strong><em>Things changed when I had to built my first prototype as an engineering student. </strong></em></p>
        <br>
        <p>I was insanely inspired by the power programming has to making a working prototype. Subsequently, I took on the programming role in my next design project and built a neonatal jaundice monitoring device using Arduino!
        The more I dwelled in Arduino, the more I fell in love with programming. However, I wasn't confident enough to pursue this interest.</p>
        <p>After university, I took a long time to ponder on what I want to dedicate my life to as a career. After several twists and turns, here I am! I am now learning, relearning and honing my programming skills.</p>


        <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
        <p>Usually people can't tell where I'm from by looking at my name, because honestly it has flavours from different cultures. Can you guess where I'm from? Drop me a message to tell me!</p>
        <p>Beside programming and science, I love spending my time cooking and baking different dishes and bakes!</p>
